                Anyone involved in web development is bound to encounter
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>. All the web applications I've
                developed so far include <strong>JavaScript</strong> code to
                varying degrees. I use this language daily, and I really
                appreciate its versatility and flexibility. I became acquainted
                with the <strong>TypeScript</strong> superset when I started
                using the Angular framework, and it's very useful in development
                because the types help a lot in discovering errors

                zwangsläufig auf JavaScript stoßen. Alle Webanwendungen, die ich
                bisher entwickelt habe, enthalten in unterschiedlichem Maße
                JavaScript-Code. Ich benutze diese Sprache täglich und schätze

                I first encountered the <strong>Go(lang)</strong> at my current
                workplace, and I was really impressed by its simplicity and
                speed. With this backend language, it's possible to write
                complex applications very quickly. The
                <strong>GORM and ECHO</strong> frameworks make database
                management and the creation of API endpoints much easier to

                The first programming language I encountered in my career was
                <strong>Java</strong>. Although the syntax seemed complicated at
                first, it was through this language that I understood the basics
                of object-oriented programming. Therefore, I wrote my first
                programs in this language as well. I also have some experience
                with the <strong>Spring framework</strong>, although I still

                During my university studies, we completed programming tasks and

                how to use them in a desktop environment. Although I haven't
                practiced these languages recently, I'm confident that I would

                My first experience with Angular was both exciting and

                and powerful features like data binding and dependency
                injection. Setting up projects with the Angular CLI was
                straightforward, and I quickly saw the efficiency in how Angular
                synchronizes the model and view. Although I initially struggled
                with routing and debugging, tools like Angular DevTools helped
                me build confidence. Learning about directives and two-way
                binding felt like unlocking a new level of control over the DOM.
                Despite the challenges, these experiences deepened my
                appreciation for Angular's capabilities.

                When I first meet RxJS it was both intriguing and daunting, as I
                encountered its complex concepts like observables, operators,
                and reactive programming. Initially, understanding how to create
                and work with observables felt overwhelming, but as I practiced,
                I began to see the power in handling asynchronous data streams.
                The vast array of operators available in RxJS was confusing at
                first, but I gradually learned how to use them to transform and
                manipulate data efficiently. Debugging reactive code presented a
                challenge, but tools like the RxJS DevTools helped me visualize
                the data flow and pinpoint issues. Despite the steep learning
                curve, working with RxJS has given me a deeper understanding of

                Diving into GORM was both fascinating and challenging,

                (Object-Relational Mapping) functions felt complex, but as I got
                more familiar with it, I started to appreciate the simplicity it
                brings to database operations. The ability to perform CRUD
                operations with minimal SQL was a game-changer, although
                figuring out relationships and associations between models
                required some extra effort. Debugging queries and understanding
                how GORM translates Go structs into database tables took time,
                but it became easier with practice. Despite the initial hurdles,
                using GORM has enhanced my ability to manage and interact with

                minimalistic approach to routing and middleware was
                straightforward, but fully grasping its power took some time.
                Handling HTTP requests and responses became smoother as I
                familiarized myself with Echo’s context management, though
                understanding how to effectively implement middleware and error
                handling required some additional learning. Debugging issues in
                Echo, particularly with custom middleware, was challenging at
                first, but with practice, I learned to trace problems more
                efficiently. Despite the learning curve, working with Echo has
                significantly improved my skills in developing fast and

                The village I'm from is located near the Austrian border, so it
                was clear that the first foreign language I would learn would be
